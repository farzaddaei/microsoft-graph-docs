[!INCLUDE [table-intro](../../includes/update-property-table-intro.md)]

|Property|Type|Description|
|:---|:---|:---|
|appliedCategories|[plannerAppliedCategories](../resources/plannerappliedcategories.md)|The categories to which the task has been applied. For possible values, see [plannerAppliedCategories](../resources/plannerappliedcategories.md). Inherited from [plannerTask](../resources/plannertask.md).|
|assigneePriority|String|Hint used to order items of this type in a list view. For details about the supported format, see [Using order hints in Planner](../resources/planner-order-hint-format.md). Inherited from [plannerTask](../resources/plannertask.md).|
|assignments|[plannerAssignments](../resources/plannerassignments.md)|The set of assignees the task is assigned to. Inherited from [plannerTask](../resources/plannertask.md).|
|bucketId|String|Bucket ID to which the task belongs. The bucket needs to be in the plan that the task is in. It is 28 characters long and case-sensitive. The [format validation](../resources/tasks-identifiers-disclaimer.md) is done on the service. Inherited from [plannerTask](../resources/plannertask.md). |
|businessScenarioProperties|[businessScenarioProperties](../resources/businessscenarioproperties.md)|Scenario-specific properties of the task. Optional.|
|conversationThreadId|String|Thread ID of the conversation on the task. This is the ID of the conversation thread object created in the **group**. Inherited from [plannerTask](../resources/plannertask.md).|
|dueDateTime|DateTimeOffset|Date and time at which the task is due. The Timestamp type represents date and time information using ISO 8601 format and is always in UTC time. For example, midnight UTC on Jan 1, 2014 is `2014-01-01T00:00:00Z`. Inherited from [plannerTask](../resources/plannertask.md).|
|orderHint|String|Hint used to order items of this type in a list view. For details about the supported format, see [Using order hints in Planner](../resources/planner-order-hint-format.md). Inherited from [plannerTask](../resources/plannertask.md).|
|percentComplete|Int32|Percentage of task completion. When set to `100`, the task is considered completed. Inherited from [plannerTask](../resources/plannertask.md). |
|planId|String|Identifier of the plan to which the task belongs. Inherited from [plannerTask](../resources/plannertask.md).|
|priority|Int32|Priority of the task. Valid range of values is between `0` and `10` (inclusive), with increasing value being lower priority (`0` has the highest priority and `10` has the lowest priority).  Currently, Planner interprets values `0` and `1` as "urgent", `2`, `3`, and `4` as "important", `5`, `6`, and `7` as "medium", and `8`, `9`, and `10` as "low".  Currently, Planner sets the value `1` for "urgent", `3` for "important", `5` for "medium", and `9` for "low". Inherited from [plannerTask](../resources/plannertask.md).|
|startDateTime|DateTimeOffset|Date and time at which the task starts. The Timestamp type represents date and time information using ISO 8601 format and is always in UTC time. For example, midnight UTC on Jan 1, 2014 is `2014-01-01T00:00:00Z`. Inherited from [plannerTask](../resources/plannertask.md).|
